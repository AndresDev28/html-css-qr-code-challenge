## My process

Started by creating the corresponding folders and files to have a good structure, even for a very simple project. Then wrote the HTML structure from the main container, container-1, and so on. Later, activated the Sass tool from the terminal to define styles from _globals.scss, and they were being saved in styles.css.

Where I had more difficulty was in adding margins and spaces, both in the title and in the paragraph inside the container that simulates the shape of a mobile. However, researching on Flexbox playground, I found an arrangement of elements that closely resembled the original design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to tackle searching for information to provide solutions to code challenges and make it look as close to the given task as possible. I also learned about the most commonly used styles within a webpage and how to structure them, although I still have much to improve and learn. The use of super useful tools like Flexbox and Sass, and how to work with and start navigating the terminal.

### Continued development

All related to HTML and CSS is my first project after completing a self-paced course on these technologies. I will continue delving into important aspects such as mobile-first design, using the inspect tool for developers in browsers, media queries, Sass, and Bootstrap, even though I haven't used the latter yet.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Playground](https://codepen.io/enxaneta/full/adLPwv/) - This helped me for flexbox display. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
